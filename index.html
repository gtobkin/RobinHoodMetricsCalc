			        		At Robin Hood, we have a unique approach to fighting poverty. Using our research-driven metrics, weâ€™re

				        	This Metrics Calculator will walk you through how we evaluate the impact of a poverty-fighting program.

	        			Most of the terms needed for bringing the social benefits forward to the present time show up in the metrics accordion above,
	        			with descriptions like "How long do job trainees spend in training before getting a job?" and "For how many years do
	        			the health benefits of vaccination last?"
	        			<br>
	        			<br>
	        			One more advanced factor we wanted to give you control over is the
	        			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_discount_rate" target=_blank>social discount rate</a>. It's analogous to the
	        			discount rate used in financial modeling, and there's a lot of interesting debate as to what an appropriate value is.
	        			Developed countries tend to use lower values (3%-7%) than developing countries (8%-15%).

			        		Westridge Academy is a not-for-profit high school serving underprivileged urban youth. A high school
			        		diploma adds about $6,500 per year to an individualâ€™s earnings, and Robin Hood considers it one of the
			        		key targets to set individuals on a track out of poverty. In addition, the quality of a studentâ€™s high
			        		school has a strong downstream effect, helping them enter more competitive colleges and boosting matriculation
			        		and graduation rates.

	      		 			CUNY reports (CUNY, 2008), but also on the findings of Tinto (2004), Kuenzi &amp; Jackson (2005), Mortenson (2006), and Jacobsen &amp; Mohker (2009).
