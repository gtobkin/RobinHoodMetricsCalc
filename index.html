	        		At Robin Hood, we have a unique approach to fighting poverty. Using our research-driven metrics, weâ€™re
	        		able to judge the social impact of a given charity and direct funding where
	        		it will do the greatest good.
	        		<br>
	        		<br>
		        	This Metrics Calculator will walk you through how we evaluate the impact of a poverty-fighting program.
	    	    	The resulting benefit/cost ratio is a big part - but only a part - of our decision to fund a nonprofit.

			        		The Manhattan Nursing Aide Career Center (MNACC) provides training and job placement services to New Yorkâ€™s un- and under-employed,
			        		helping them find work as a nursing aide. This career track is a promising route out of poverty for a variety of reasons:
			        		it pays around $9.50 an hour, has reasonable education requirements, and is expected to grow as Baby Boomers
			        		keep retiring.

			        <div class="twoColumn">
			        	<p class="body">
			        		Another advantage for MNACC is that trainees are primarily women and may not speak English as a primary language, suggesting they
		        			would otherwise be disadvantaged in the job market.
		        			<br>
		        			<br>
							Here, the grant under consideration will pay for additional instructors and support staff, letting the Career Center handle
							additional trainees.

							We base our estimate of the impact of academic progress on earnings on Levin et al (2007).  To Levinâ€™s earnings data (excluding
							the white subsample), we add an estimate of fringe benefits.  Based on data from our grantees, we estimate that 60 percent of
							our parent workers receive fringe benefits (averaging 20 percent of their wages).
